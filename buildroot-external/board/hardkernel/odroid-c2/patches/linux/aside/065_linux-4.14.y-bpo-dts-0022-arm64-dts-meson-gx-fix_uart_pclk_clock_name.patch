Subject: [PATCH] ARM64: dts: meson-gx: fix UART pclk clock name
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The clock-names for pclk was wrongly set to "core", but the bindings
specifies "pclk".
This was not cathed until the legacy non-documented bindings were removed.

Reported-by: Andreas FÃ¤rber <afaerber@suse.de>
Fixes: f72d6f6037b7 ("ARM64: dts: meson-gx: use stable UART bindings with correct gate clock")
